## BeBox

I needed a small Linux box for my desk; this means I needed a Raspberry Pi. I didn't want a 'normal' case, so I made a tiny BeBox:

A BeBox, [if you're not aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeBox) is a weird little computer from the mid-90s, and could have been the basis for OS X. About 2000 were ever made, making this one of the rarest vintage computers. Unobtanium, basically.

The entire thing is built around a Raspberry Pi 4, with a dual-HDMI extension board to make all the ports come out on the back. Blinkenlights are included, programmable with a Python script and a MCP23017 I2C/GPIO chip. The 'blue' part of the case is suitable for a filament printer, while the gray is better suited for resin.
