# Quarter-Scale Retrocomputing

![Render of tiny computers](/images/TinyComputers.png)

This is an ongoing project that began as a search for a cool Raspberry Pi case. I couldn't find something cool, so I decided to build my own. The first completed case was the BeBox, and expanded to the X68000 (as a plastic model kit I found in Japan), the SGI Indy, and the eMachines Never Obsolete (as a thorough exploration in the limits of waterslide decals).

These projects are detailed below:

## BeBox

I needed a small Linux box for my desk; this means I needed a Raspberry Pi. I didn't want a 'normal' case, so I made a tiny BeBox:

A BeBox, [if you're not aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeBox) is a weird little computer from the mid-90s, and could have been the basis for OS X. About 2000 were ever made, making this one of the rarest vintage computers. Unobtanium, basically.

The entire thing is built around a Raspberry Pi 4, with a dual-HDMI extension board to make all the ports come out on the back. Blinkenlights are included, programmable with a Python script and a MCP23017 I2C/GPIO chip. The 'blue' part of the case is suitable for a filament printer, while the gray is better suited for resin.

## The eMachines Never Obsolete

This was an experiment in detailed scale modeling, specifically scaling down stickers and silkscreen. The obvious choice for a computer to test these techniques on is the eMachines Never Obsolete from c.2000; these computers came plastered with stickers, and existant machines are highly regarded in the sleeper / retrobattlestation community. I had to make this computer, and it had to have all the stickers.

The process for building this Raspberry Pi case is similar to all the other ones -- the main body is 3D printed on a filament printer, the detailed parts (in this case, the front) are printed in fine detail resin. The trick for this case is the many waterslide decals. These were designed in Illustrator, then sent off to someone with an Alps dye sub printer. Application is relatively easy with the right tools, specifically Micro Sol and Micro Set solution, along with an airbrush.

## X68000

The Sharp X68000 was a popular workstation in late 80s / early 90s Japan. On a trip to Japan, [I picked up a model](https://twitter.com/ViolenceWorks/status/1585988854917439488) of this computer, meant to be a Raspberry Pi case.

The model required paint and application of waterslide decals, but I also picked up an airbrush in Japan. A simple build, and it fits Raspberry Pi 2s and 3s.

## SGI Indy

Blah Blah something goes here

## Viewsonic Monitor

Also something
