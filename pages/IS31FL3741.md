## IS31FL3741 LED Driver Library

I was the first person in the US to purchase a IS31FL3741; a reel of chips in February, 2018. As I was the first person to get these chips, no driver or example code existed, so I had to write my own.

The library talks to the chip over I2C, with the data formatted to a 18x18 array; this is in contrast to the datasheet's recommendation of a 9x36 array.
