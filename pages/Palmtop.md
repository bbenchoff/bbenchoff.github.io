## Injection Molded Palmtop

A product design for a portable dumb terminal, using injection molding. A side project of the [portable dumb terminal](/dumb.html).

Because the quantities required for the portable dumb terminal are incompatable with rapid prototyping, injection molding was chosen as the manufacturing technology. The device was modeled in Fusion360 and sent to manufacturing.

Challenges presented during the design of this enclosure included manufacturing for design; this included draft angles, wall thickness, bosses, and consideration for plastic flow.
