## Serial Fidget Spinner

The during the development of the [portable dumb terminal](/pages/dumb.html), I needed a way to compare my [terminal parser library](/pages/parser.html) to real hardware. The solution is a serial Y-cable. Since I have a 3D printer and a pack of skateboard bearings, I made a serial fidget spinner:

Yes, it works. It's a tri-directional RS-232 cable. No, it doesn't spin well, even after I soaked the bearings in alcohol.
