## 3D Printed Treads

Half-tracked vehicles are cool. If I could have any vehicle to tool around town, it would be a US Army M2 half-track, a Sonderkraftfahrzeug 11, [Lenin's Silver Ghost conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A9gresse_track#/media/File:Rolls-Royce_Silver_Ghost_K%C3%A9gresse.jpg), or some bizzare conversion meant for back country in the snow.

I'm also a child of the 90s, and back then Tyco / Tamiya sold a series of _really cool_ remote control toys that included various buggies, a hovercraft, and some tracked vehicles, the most popular being the FastTraxx. But the fully-tracked FastTraxx isn't a half-tracked vehicle; the coolest one was the HalfTraxx.

I had a Tyco HalfTraxx when I was eight, and after finding one at a flea market I had to buy this bit of my childhood. The bad news is that the treads had rotted away after three decades. The good news is that I now have a 3D printer and some CAD skills.

Consider this a proof-of-concept for 3D-printed tank treads. The treads were printed in TPU filament, slowly, at 240Â°C. It fits on the car, and the steering on the HalfTraxx is just as bad as I remember. This technique can easily be expanded to the vastly more popular Tyco car, the FastTraxx.
