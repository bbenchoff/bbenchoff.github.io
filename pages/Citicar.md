This is an ongoing log of the restoration of a 1980 Comuta-Car, acquired from a Craigslist ad in Fresno.

### Acquiring the car

Tips and tricks for acquiring a Commutacar: It *barely* fits in the back of a 10-foot UHaul truck. The easiest way to get it home is to rent a 10-foot UHaul, buy some ramps at Harbor Freight, and get three people to push it up into the truck. Without the batteries it only weighs ~700 pounds. No, you don't need a trailer, in fact a citicar does not fit on a the UHaul car trailer because the wheelbase is too narrow.

The current plan is to redo the wiring and get it moving with stock parts under its own power. After that, an upgrade is in order with a better motor controller. Then possibly lithium batteries, a J1772 socket, and a complete refurbishment of the bodywork. I'm thinking seafoam green.
