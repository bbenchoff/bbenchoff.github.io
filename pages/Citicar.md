## 1980 Citicar / Comuta-Car, Restoration

This is an ongoing log of the restoration of a 1980 Comuta-Car, acquired from a Craigslist ad in Fresno.

### Acquiring the car

The car was bought [off of Craigslist](/images/Car/Craigslist/Screencap.PNG) in Coarsegold, California, about half an hour north of Fresno. The bill of sale says $200 because eventually this will be in a Lemons rally. Getting it to my SF garage involved driving out to Fresno, picking up a 10' UHaul box truck and car trailer, and bringing it home through Gilroy. 

Tips and tricks for acquiring a Commutacar: [It *barely* fits in the back of a 10-foot UHaul truck](https://bbenchoff.github.io/images/Car/Acquiring/2.jpg). The easiest way to get it home is to rent a 10-foot UHaul, buy some ramps at Harbor Freight, and get three people to push it up into the truck. Without the batteries it only weighs ~700 pounds. No, you don't need a trailer, in fact a citicar does not fit on a the UHaul car trailer because the wheelbase is too narrow.

### Week 1, Teardown and I found a motor controller

Week 1 began with getting it up on jack stands. This revealed some [weirdness with the back suspension](https://bbenchoff.github.io/images/Car/Week1/1.png). For some reason, half a leaf spring was bolted to the driver's side suspension. I don't know what's going on there. The [wiring under the dashwas a mess](https://bbenchoff.github.io/images/Car/Week1/5.png), and the 120 Volt input [was highly dangerous](https://twitter.com/BBenchoff/status/1484325182399340554) so that was torn out to be replaced with all new wiring.

During the teardown, I was looking at this weird box right next to the motor. The car still had the original contactors (the old "speed controller"), and I had assumed the previous owner was still trying to use this. Not so, because that weird box [was a brand new motor controller](/images/Car/Week1/7.png). To reiterate, I found an unused motor controller worth $1000 in a car I paid $1000 for. I bought a motor controller and got a free car.

Given the serial number on the unused motor controller, a few parts on the wiring harness, and the oral history of the car from the seller, I think I can put together a reasonably correct history of this car. Sometime after 1993 and before 2000, the car was in Palm Springs where the owner decided a refurbishment was in order. This person had the knowledge to walk into NAPA auto, but not the skills to put those parts together. The last time it was registered was in 2000, after which it was moved to Coarsegold, half an hour north of Fresno. In 2022, I brought it to San Francisco where it is currently undergoing restoration.

After a few days of reverse-engineering the wiring, we determined the best course of action would be to [tear out all the wires](/images/Car/Week1/8.png) and rebuild the entire electrical system from the ground up. This gave me an oppurtunity to clean out twenty years of detritus in the under-seat compartment. This was a weird, sticky goo that cleaned up with soap and water. I also found a mouse nest inside the ventilation/cooling manifold; this was removed, cleaned in the dishwasher, and reinstalled.

With that done, the project moves onto re-wiring the electrical system. This will be guided in part by the schematics found in the CommtaCar service manual but updated for a modern fuse panel.
