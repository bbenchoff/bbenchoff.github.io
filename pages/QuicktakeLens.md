## A Nikon Lens Adapter for the Apple Quicktake 150, the First Digital Camera*

Wherin I write a few thousand words on photography without using the word 'boekh'.

I'd like to start this by saying the Apple Quicktake was not the _first_ digital camera. People on the Internet would say that honor goes to a Kodak prototype from 1975. If you're looking for a commercial device, the "first digital camera" was a Fuji DS-1P from 1988, the Dycam Model 1, Logitech Fotoman, or MegaVision Tessera from 1987 to 1991, or thereabouts. Everyone who claiming one of these devices is the 'first digital camera' is wrong, because that honor actually goes to the [Cromeco Cyclops](https://hackaday.com/2016/04/17/building-the-first-digital-camera/), a digital camera from February, 1975 that could create an image with 32x32 resolution. It's actually a decapsulated DRAM chip and a C-mount lens adapter sold as a kit, but that's the first digital camera, beating the Kodak prototype by a few months.

The Apple Quicktake, though, was the first digital camera anyone could buy. Just go back to 1994 and walk into a Sears, or a Montgomery Ward, or a Babbage's, or an Electronics Boutique, and you could buy a digital camera. It cost $749 back then.

In any event, that's not what I say whenever someone comes up and asks me what camera I'm using. I just say, 'It's the first digital camera. Made by Apple.' They usually reply, 'oh, cool.'

## The Quicktake 150 and Lens Adapter

The Quicktake 100 (and Quicktake 150) are digital cameras witha CCD sensor capable of taking pictures at a resolution of 640x480. The camera has a fixed focus, fixed focal length equivalant of 50mm, and auto aperture (ranging from f/2.8 to f/16) and exposure (from 1/30th to 1/175th of a second). The camera can store eight (with the Quicktake 100) or sixteen (Quicktake 150) images at 640x480 resolution, or double the number of pictures at 320x240. There is no LCD screen to show you what your picture looks like, and the only way to view your pictures is to connect the camera (by serial!) to an old computer. This means you need to keep an old pre-OS X Mac around. Something with serial ports. The software to download images does not run on system software higher than System 7.5.6. The camera has extrodinarly low light sensitivity, and taking pictures in twilight or indoors results in a dull, underexposed image. This is a terrible camera.

**But why?**

Despite the technical shortcomings, the Apple Quicktake does actually produce nice photos, despite itself. I would characterize the images as being like oil paintings, cloistered away in an attic for a century or so, until the varnish oxidizes. It's dull, it's matte, it's a bit desaturated, but it still somehow looks good. Here's an example, comparing a modern smartphone camera (Pixel 2) with the Quicktake 150:
