## Performance

Unsurprisingly, doing extremely parallel operations in a GPU is _fast_. But how does it compare to other Autorouters? Before I get into this, I must say I've come to the conclusion that assessing PCB routing is not objective. Board layout is a qualia. Yes, there's RF considerations, impedance, stackup, and manufacturability concerns, but a 'good' board layout is a subjective criterion.

It's like airplanes. Aesthetics correlates with good engineering. If it looks good, it'll probably fly. Even if it looks _weird_, but good, it'll probably fly. You develop a sense of this after looking at tens of thousands of circuit boards or reading _Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft_ cover to cover, you start to get a sense of these things.

That being said, this autorouter doesn't quite produce _good_ boards. Like all autorouters, I suppose. But it will produce a _valid_ circuit board. And it does it fast.

SOMETHING ABOUT PERFORMANCE WHEN I GET THE AUTOROUTING DONE This paragraph is going to compare Orthoroute vs other autorouters in speed, and what they look like
