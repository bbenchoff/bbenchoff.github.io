## Frog Design-inspired Mini-ITX enclosure

Inspired by the the best industrial design for computer cases of the 90s -- Packard Bell -- I decided to build my own Frog Design-inspired computer case. It supports a Mini ITX motherboard, with provisions for dual card slots.

The design offers little in the way for space for extended graphics cards, but in the mid-90s, graphics cards weren't that big, anyway. Of note is the slot-load DVD drive; although the DVD drive is slightly anachronistic, it does suit the design nicely.

## SGI-inspired Micro Quad-3.5" drive tower

A take-off of the big Zip drive tower, this enclosure fits four 3.5" drives, power supply, and interface electronics.

The design is inspired by the SGI O2, with a dash of Power Macintosh 6400. With four Zip 250 drives, this enclosure holds an entire gigabyte of data, accessable over USB 2 High Speed interface. This does not saturate the USB connection; the bottleneck is the drives.
