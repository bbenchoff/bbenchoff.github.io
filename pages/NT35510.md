## NT35510 TFT Library

A TFT driver for LCDs based on the NE35510 chipset.

The [portable dumb terminal](https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/dumb.html) required a TFT display with a relativley large pixel density -- at least 800 pixels wide on a panel about 4" in size. Economical displays with these specifications are rare, and where they do exist the drivers do not. This means I wrote a TFT driver.

For maximum speed, the driver writes to the display over a 16-bit wide '8080 bus', although this can be easily extended to a SPI bus. 

More information can be found in my [Dumb Terminal repository](https://github.com/bbenchoff/Dumb-Badge).
