# Fuck you. Print the neck too.

3D printed guitars have been around for a decade at this point. The pattern is always the same: 3D print a guitar body with a socket for an off-the-shelf bolt-on neck, screw it in, and call it a 3D printed guitar. You people keep doing the same thing and expect the next thing to be interesting or innovative. Fuck you. Print the neck too.

__This__ is an entirely 3D printed guitar. Minus some hardware (tuners, bridge, pickups, electronics, knobs) and some small bits that _could_ be 3D printed (the bone nut, frets), this thing came off a relatively standard 3D printer.

Because I wanted to demonstrate that a 3D printed guitar neck is possible, I chose a neck-through design. The most iconic neck-through electric guitar is the Gibson Firebird, so I went with that. This proved to be somewhat difficult to model; the fret board is angled 3 degrees from the top of the body, and the headstock is angled 13 degrees from the plane of the fret board:

Modeling the Firebird silhouette is well-trodden territory; the hard part is engineering a printed neck that survives 120lbs of string tension.

The slight innovation here is a double-action truss rod, with carbon fiber neck rods running the length of the neck. These are [from Stewmac](https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/materials/truss-rods/carbon-fiber/carbon-fiber-neck-rods/), and are 0.200″ × 0.250″ × 18″, trimmed slightly to length, shaving off a quarter inch of their 18″ length.

With this, the entire guitar body, the fret board, and even the inlays are 3D printed. The 'sides' or 'wings' are bolted on with a 'tongue and groove' joint.
