# A $15 Linux Computer, or a Linux Swiss Army Knife

![Front of Device](/images/Linux/Front.png)

This project is an exploration of how inexpensive a computer can be. In the end, I ended up designing a 'Linux Swiss Army Knife', or a device capable of doing everything a normal computer does

## Design & Expansion

The 'back' of the device contains all the ports. These include a USB Type-A port, where you can easily attach a WiFi or Bluetooth adapter, USB keyboard, webcam, or really *any other device*. lsusb works, so have fun with that.

Additionally, the storage on this device is through a SD card -- 

## What can it do?

What can a $15 Linux computer do? First off, yes, [it can run Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom). Chocolate Doom is actually a default package in Buildroot, which is awesome.


## In Closing, or, A Hammer for the Mind

I hate to invoke Steve Jobs on this, but one of the most insightful things he ever said was his ['Bicycle for the Mind' anecdote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c). In this story, Jobs read a story in Scientific American where scientists tested the efficiency of locomotion for dozens of species. The condor was most efficient, or able to travel a kilometer using the least amount of energy. Humans were middling, about a third of the way down the list. However, Jobs tells, someone at Scientific American had the insight to test a human *on a bicycle*. Here, the bike blew every other animal away, and because of technology, humans are the most efficient species on the planet. The computer is a bicycle for the mind, allowing us to do more _thought_ easier and with less energy.

It's a brilliant anecdote showcasing what computers can do now, but also what would be possible in the future with further advances in computing. The story is also complete bullshit, because humans evolved to be pursuit hunters able to out-walk an antelope. Humans don't need to be the most efficient animal, humans just need to be more efficient than an antelope. But I digress...

This anecdote ties 'humans as tool-builders' and 'humans are the supreme animal' into a neat little package, but it fails to mention the tools needed to build a bicycle. We need hammers, we need wreches, and we need knowledge of fairly advanced metullurgy.

That's what this device is. It's a tool used to fix our computers. If you need a serial terminal, just grab this device and a USB to FTDI thingy, and you've got a serial terminal. Want to flash a microcontroller? This thing has AVRDude built in. Want to listen to Starlink satellites? Just plug in an SDR. That's what this device is: a tool to fix computers, or a Hammer for the Mind.
