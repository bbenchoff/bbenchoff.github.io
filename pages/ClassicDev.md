## Classic Mac Development

 <img src="/images/MetrowerksCD.png" alt="The Metrowerks Guy" align="right" hspace="10" width="268">

 This is the page I'm using for a description of my Classic Mac development environment. This is how I make software for old Macintosh computers from the Macintosh SE to the titanium PowerBook G4. 

### Hardware

 The era I'm targeting spans a vast array of hardware, with a vast difference between the minimum and maximum hardware something something

 My main workstation is a **Power Macintosh G3**, desktop case, OS 8.6, with 544MB of RAM, and a BlueSCSI with a few different sized volumes. This is where the development happens, with testing on lower-spec systems: A **PowerBook Duo 2300c and Duo 280c** form my mobile fleet, representing the tail end of the M68k and beginnings of PPC eras. I need a mobile old mac for photography work, and Duos are the last ones with an easily reparable battery. BlueSCSI for the 280 and a very large Compact Flash card for the 2300. Finally, An **SE/30** is the low end of my fleet, with 128MB of RAM and Gigabyte-sized volumes thanks to another BlueSCSI. I see no reason my software should target anything lower.

### IDE

I'm using **Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 4**...
