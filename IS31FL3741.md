## IS31FL3741 LED Driver Library

The <a href="https://www.issi.com/WW/pdf/IS31FL3741.pdf">IS31FL3741</a> is a LED driver chip produced by ISSI capable of driving 351 single-color LEDs as a matrix. This chip foremed the core functionality of the [Mr Robot Badge](https://github.com/bbenchoff/MrRobotBadge).

I was the first to develop a library for this chip; ISSI announced the chip in February, and I purchased the first reel of chips in May. The units shipped in July.

I plays Snake on a 18x18 matrix of LEDs.

More information can be found in the [Repository of the Mr Robot Badge](https://github.com/bbenchoff/MrRobotBadge).
