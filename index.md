# **Benchoff Design Portfolio**  
### **Hardware, Embedded Systems & Strange Projects**

I design, build, and reverse-engineer **hardware, embedded systems, and unconventional tech**. My work spans **low-level firmware, PCB design, industrial design, and creative problem-solving**—whether that’s modernizing a **1970s electric car**, designing a **$15 Linux handheld**, or reverse-engineering **legacy consumer electronics**.

🛠 **What I Do Best:**  
✔ Embedded Systems (RP2040, STM32, AVR, Linux SBCs)  
✔ Hardware & PCB Design (High-Speed, CAN Bus, DAQ, Power Systems)  
✔ Industrial Design & Manufacturing (3D Printing, CNC, Injection Molding)  
✔ Reverse Engineering & Hacking (Legacy Hardware, Retrocomputing, UI/UX)
