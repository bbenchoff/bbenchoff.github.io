## Design Portfolio

I design strange things in hardware and software. Highlights include:

- <a href="https://www.exaluminal.com/">Exaluminal</a>, a device that tell you the Earth will be destroyed by a supernova hours before it happens. This was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31760485">#1 on Hacker News</a>, but Orange Website Bad.

- Here's a <a href="http://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/LinuxDevice.html">$15 Linux Machine</a>. Also #1 on Hacker News, but Orange Website Bad.
