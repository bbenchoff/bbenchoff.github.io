## Design Portfolio

I design strange things in hardware and software. Highlights include:

- I converted a car without semiconductors <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/CANconversion.html">to use CAN for everything</a>.

- <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/QuicktakeLens.html">A Nikon lens adapter</a> for the first digital camera.

- <a href="https://www.640by480.com/">I made an Instagram clone</a> for my pics of San Francisco take with vintage digital cameras.

- <a href="https://www.exaluminal.com/">Exaluminal</a>, a device that tell you the Earth will be destroyed by a supernova hours before it happens. This was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31760485">#1 on Hacker News</a>, but Orange Website Bad.

- Here's a <a href="http://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/LinuxDevice.html">$15 Linux Machine</a>. Also #1 on Hacker News, but Orange Website Bad.

- I'm restoring <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/Citicar.html">a vintage electric car</a>

- The time <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/MrRobot.html">I built a blockchain of Tide pods</a>
	- This was part of the <a href="https://github.com/bbenchoff/MrRobotBadge">indie DEFCON badge I made</a>
- Reverse engineering <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/atapi.html">20-year-old consumer electronics
	- You would not belive how useful a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pixiss-Fiberglass-5-inches-Corrosion-Electrical/dp/B07M94Y12J">fiberglass pen</a> is.
- I made <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/colorPCB.html">full-color printed circuit boards</a>

- I also do CAD work
	- <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/keyboard.html">With molded silicone</a>
	- <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/Palmtop.html">and injection molded plastic</a>
- And embedded development:
	- <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/NT35510.html">Write a TFT driver they said</a>
	- <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/parser.html">There is no standard for terminal escape codes</a>
	- <a href="https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/IS31FL3741.html">Now-unobtanium LED drivers</a>
