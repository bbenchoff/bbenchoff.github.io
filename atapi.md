## Zip Drive Tower

**What is it?** It's a tower of Zip drives, all connected over USB. This demands a picture, so:

The Zip drive tower is built from fifteen ATAPI Zip-100 drives. A custom board was made for fifteen ATAPI-to-USB

**Why build this?** There are two reasons I built the Zip drive tower. The _least_ important reason is to build a RAID array. This turned out to be just as useless as expected; the array is slow (as Zip drives are very slow) and in RAID 0 configuration only presents a volume ~1.5GB in size. It also draws about 15 Amps at 5V on startup, so it's far less economical than a thumb drive.
